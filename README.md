The following steps can be followed to run this in your local system and use a mobile (both devices connected to the same LAN/wifi network) to generate and send data:
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Make sure you have NodeJS installed and added to path.
3. Make sure you have VSCode installed.
4. Open VSCode to the repository folder.
6. On VSCode terminal type `node index.js`.
7. Follow the instructions to resolve any issues.
8. For visualization/teacher view: Open browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should be able to generate a classroom code.
9. Open windows command prompt and type `ipconfig` and search for the IPv4 Address (something like 192.168.1.100), let's call it YOUR_LOCAL_IP.
10. For data collection/student view: On mobile/alternate device browser address bar type http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3000/user.html (replacing YOUR_LOCAL_IP with the IPv4 address).
